## State

The current state of the code is at best alpha quality. It should not be used in a production environment under any circumstance.

## Motivation

After searching for a JavaScript implementation for .NET that was both decently fast, easy to interop with from C# and actively developed for well over two months it seemed like if I wanted it I'd have to write it myself.
