* Hidden classes (stolen from V8)
* Building hidden classes at compile time for resolvable cases
* Inline caching (CallSite<T> for most, custom for property access)
* Compile time analysis of global/local variables
* Static caching of CallSite<T> and MethodInfo objects
* Custom closures classes, resolved at compile time, using IjsClosureCell<T>
