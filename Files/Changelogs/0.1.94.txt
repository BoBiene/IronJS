### Changelog for 0.1.94 ###

* Simplified Array.prototype.shift and also fixed a bug that caused deleted 
  indexes to take precendence over existing ones
* Implemented Array.prototype.sort
* Split functionality from Object into Object, ValueObject and ArrayObject to
  decrease the memory overhead of normal (non array/value) objects by 40 bytes. 
* Fixed a bug where delegates with "Box array" and "Object array" as last
  parameter would fail if no arguments were supplied
* Fixed a bug where the calls to DynamicScope.get and DynamicScope.set had
  gotten their arguments switched causing any usage of the with statement
  to crash the runtime
* Cleaned up Compiler.Core.compile
